# dB Converter
The 'dB Converter' is a standalone application that allows you to convert voltage or power measurements of an electrical signal to decibels. It converts to the most common units of level used in audio outside the digital realm, such as dBV, dBu and dBm.

This project is built using the JUCE framework and modern C++ (C++17). The GUI is really intuitive and pretty straight forward. Result and units of measurement are automatically updated each time you choose a different conversion from the menu.
